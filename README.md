# ColdShard CLI
This is the official CLI for ColdShard. This allows you to do whatever it is you would've done on our panel, *but in the command line* ðŸ¤¯ðŸŽ‰!

## Installation
It's very simple to install this CLI. You must have Python and PIP installed. Just run the following command:
```bash
pip install coldshard-cli
```

## Usage
To use this CLI, first you need to login. To do this, login at the [panel](https://panel.coldshard.com) and create an [API Key](https://panel.coldshard.com/account/api). Copy it and then login by running the following command:
```bash
coldshard login --api-token [KEY HERE]
```
Alternatively you can just run `coldshard login` and you will be prompted to enter your API key.

After you have logged in, you can simply run `coldshard --help` to see all the commands you can run.
